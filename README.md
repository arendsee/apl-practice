# APL practice

APL is a strange language. I will not try to master it, but I want to capture
the concepts and culture of the language.

Unfortunately, the APL family seems to be dominated by non-open actors, who
market the language mostly to fat cats in finance. There is a GNU
implementation of APL, but it is incredibly buggy. I have requested
a non-commercial license to the Dyalog APL derivative. The Dyalog group is
pretty active and they don't seem completely beholden to the finance sector.
